idk dude i had to install windows subsystem for linux
for a linux emulator, then checked the file type with 'file' command
it's an ELF file but no elf command, u had to run it with bash with ./'filename'
course that didn't work cuz the permissions are weird so i followed the web
https://ctftime.org/writeup/26531
used chmod +x chall
that worked idk how it did, something about changing the file itu an exe in linux terms
then combined that string with the string u get when connecting to the server with nc
